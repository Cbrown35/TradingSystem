## Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Credentials

1. Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Rotate API keys regularly
4. Use separate API keys for development and production

### Configuration

```json
{
  "Security": {
    "ApiKeyTimeout": 3600,
    "MaxLoginAttempts": 5,
