# Backtesting Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the backtesting methodology used in our trading system to evaluate trading strategies using historical data.

## Data Sources
- Historical price data from multiple exchanges
- Order book snapshots and updates
- Trading volume data
- Market sentiment indicators
- Economic indicators (when applicable)

## Simulation Components

### Market Data Replay
- Tick-by-tick data replay
- Order book reconstruction
- Volume profile analysis
- Time-series synchronization
- Gap handling and adjustment

### Order Execution
- Realistic order filling based on liquidity
- Slippage modeling
- Transaction cost analysis
- Market impact simulation
- Partial fills handling

### Position Management
- Position sizing rules
- Risk management constraints
- Margin requirements
- Funding rate calculations (for perpetual contracts)
- Overnight holding costs

## Performance Metrics

### Return Metrics
- Total Return
- Annualized Return
- Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio)
- Maximum Drawdown
- Recovery Factor

### Risk Metrics
- Value at Risk (VaR)
- Expected Shortfall
- Beta
- Correlation with market
- Volatility measures

### Trading Metrics
- Win Rate
- Profit Factor
- Average Win/Loss Ratio
- Maximum Consecutive Losses
- Trade Duration Statistics

## Validation Methods

### Walk-Forward Analysis
1. In-sample optimization
2. Out-of-sample testing
3. Rolling window analysis
4. Parameter sensitivity testing

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Random seed variation
- Market condition permutation
- Parameter perturbation
- Confidence interval calculation

## Common Pitfalls and Mitigations

### Look-Ahead Bias
- Strict chronological data processing
- Future data access prevention
- Point-in-time database reconstruction

### Survivorship Bias
- Inclusion of delisted assets
- Historical universe reconstruction
- Proper handling of corporate actions

### Overfitting Prevention
- Cross-validation
- Parameter regularization
- Complexity penalties
- Out-of-sample validation

## Reporting

### Performance Reports
- Equity curve analysis
- Drawdown analysis
- Trade list and statistics
- Risk metric summary

### Strategy Analysis
- Market regime analysis
- Parameter sensitivity
- Transaction cost impact
- Risk factor decomposition

## Implementation Guidelines

### Data Preparation
1. Data cleaning and validation
2. Time series alignment
3. Missing data handling
4. Outlier detection and treatment

### Execution Engine
1. Order matching logic
2. Price impact modeling
3. Fee structure implementation
4. Position tracking

### Risk Management
1. Position size limits
2. Stop-loss implementation
3. Exposure monitoring
4. Correlation checks

## Best Practices

1. Always use out-of-sample testing
2. Include transaction costs
3. Consider market impact
4. Test across different market conditions
5. Implement realistic constraints
6. Document assumptions and limitations
7. Regular strategy monitoring and validation
